# gp-data-download-wms

This repository contains a technical proposal for 'Making spatial data downloadable via WMS services'. It is published in the form of [the guidelines document](https://github.com/marcingrudzien/gp-data-download-wms/blob/main/gp-data-download-wms.md) allowing organisations to set up WMS services, allowing users to download the spatial relatively easily and intuitively.

Development of the guidelines is a follow-up to [INSPIRE Good Practice proposal](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/good-practice/making-spatial-data-downloadable-wms-services).
